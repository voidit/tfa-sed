HSL

The hue in degrees from 0 to 359.
0 = red, 60 = yellow, 120 = green, 180 = cyan, 240 = blue, and 300 = magenta.

Saturation 0% - 100%
100% will be the full hue, and saturation of 0 will give you a shade of gray—essentially causing the hue value to be ignored.

Lightness 0% - 100%
A percentage for lightness with 50% being the norm.
Lightness of 100% will be white, 50% will be the actual hue, and 0% will be black.

Last, but certainly not least, CSS Color Module Level 3 provides us with currentColor. The currentColor keyword is equal to the current element’s color property.

In CSS Colors Level 4, we get four- and eight-digit hex colors with the last digit(s) specifying transparency, hwb() and hwba() to specify colors by hue, whiteness and blackness, plus a gray() function to enable a shorter method for declaring shades of gray.
